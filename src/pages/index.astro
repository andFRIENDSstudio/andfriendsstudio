Their respective backgrounds span the areas of graphic and motion design, fine art, immersive installations, and live events. From these diverse and interdisciplinary talents, their approach to art is medium-agnostic, centering instead on expressing and evoking reflection, community, and wonder. As individuals, their work has contributed to some of the most widely recognized shows in entertainment in association with many top-tier studios."
